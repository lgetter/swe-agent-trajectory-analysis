  "Traj ID": "pylint-dev__pylint-4970",
  "Issue Summary": "The issue was in the `_iter_sims` method in '/testbed/pylint/checkers/similar.py'. When `min-similarity-lines` was set to 0, instead of disabling duplicate code checking, the checker would treat every single line as duplicate code and flood the output with false positives. The root cause was that the similarity checking logic didn't have a guard clause to short-circuit when min_lines equals 0.",
  "Interaction Summary": "The agent systematically explored the codebase to understand the similarity checking mechanism. It created multiple versions of a reproduction script, facing challenges with pylint's API, particularly struggling to understand how to properly initialize the SimilarChecker and add files for testing. The agent made extensive use of view commands to examine the similar.py file, reading through various methods to understand the control flow and identify where the fix should be applied.",
  "Reproduction Code": "The agent created 'reproduce.py' starting at step 9 to verify the issue. Initially, the script had several API-related errors that required fixes. The agent created multiple iterations of the reproduction script, updating it at steps 12, 13, 14, and 20 to correct import errors and method calls.",
  "1.1": "YES",
  "1.2": "The reproduction script went through several iterations before working correctly. At step 11, the agent removed an invalid Config import. At step 12, the agent changed from using a Config object to a simple dictionary for configuration. At step 13, the agent updated the checker initialization to directly set min_lines instead of using set_config. At step 20, the agent significantly rewrote the script to create a test_duplicate_check function that could test both min_lines=0 and min_lines=2 cases. However, at step 21, the script still had errors because the agent was trying to use a non-existent add_file method.",
  "Search for the issue": "The agent used find commands combined with grep to locate relevant files. At step 2, the agent searched for files containing 'duplicate' or 'similarity' keywords. At step 3, it searched for files containing 'min-similarity-lines' to narrow down the search.",
  "2.1": "YES",
  "2.2": "The agent executed two find commands during the search process. The first command at step 2 was 'find /testbed -type f -name \"*.py\" | grep -i \"duplicate\\|similarity\"' which identified similar.py as a key file. The second command at step 3 was 'find /testbed -type f -name \"*.py\" | xargs grep -l \"min-similarity-lines\"' to find files specifically referencing the configuration parameter. After locating similar.py, the agent used grep at step 5 to search for 'min-similarity-lines' within the file, finding it at lines 737 and 803. The agent then systematically viewed different sections of similar.py using str_replace_editor view commands to understand the code structure.",
  "Edit the Code": "The fix was implemented at step 19 in the `_iter_sims` method of '/testbed/pylint/checkers/similar.py'. The agent added a guard clause 'if self.min_lines == 0: return' right after the method's docstring and before the nested loops. This simple two-line addition prevents any similarity checking from occurring when min_lines is set to 0, effectively disabling the duplicate code checker as intended by users.",
  "Test changes on the reproduction code": "The agent attempted to test the changes by running the reproduction script multiple times. After implementing the fix at step 19, the agent updated the reproduction script at step 20 to better test both cases (min_lines=0 and min_lines>0). However, the test execution at step 21 revealed that the reproduction script still had API errors with the SimilarChecker class.",
  "4.1": "NO",
  "4.2": "The reproduction script failed with an AttributeError at step 21, indicating that 'SimilarChecker' object has no attribute 'add_file'. This shows the agent was struggling to understand the correct API for testing the SimilarChecker class. The agent then spent steps 22-76 exploring the similar.py file more deeply, using grep to search for methods like '__init__', 'check_files', and 'append_stream' to understand how to properly use the checker. Despite implementing the correct fix to the actual issue, the agent was unable to create a working test script to verify the fix, suggesting the trajectory ended without successful test validation.",
