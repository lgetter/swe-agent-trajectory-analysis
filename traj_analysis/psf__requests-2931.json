  "Issue Summary": "The issue was in the 'to_native_string' function in '/testbed/requests/utils.py'. When binary payloads were passed (like u\"ööö\".encode(\"utf-8\")), the function tried to decode them using ASCII encoding by default. This caused an error because non-ASCII characters couldn't be decoded with the ASCII codec. The problem was introduced in version 2.9 and affected requests with binary data.",
  "Interaction Summary": "The agent worked efficiently through a 15-step process to identify and fix the issue. It started by exploring the codebase structure, then used grep to locate the problematic 'to_native_string' function. After understanding the issue, it created a reproduction script, confirmed the error, applied a fix, and thoroughly tested edge cases. The entire debugging and fixing process was systematic and well-structured.",
  "Reproduction Code": "The agent created 'reproduce_error.py' at step 8 and 'test_edge_cases.py' at step 13.",
  "1.1": "YES",
  "1.2": "The agent created reproduce_error.py at step 8 to verify the issue with binary payloads. This script attempted to send a PUT request with UTF-8 encoded data containing non-ASCII characters (u\"ööö\".encode(\"utf-8\")). When executed at step 9, it confirmed the error with the message \"'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)\". Later, at step 13, the agent created test_edge_cases.py to validate the fix against multiple scenarios. This comprehensive test script checked six different cases: UTF-8 encoded strings, empty binary data, Latin-1 encoded strings, binary data with null bytes, regular strings, and None values. All test cases passed successfully when run at step 14, confirming the fix handled various edge cases correctly.",
  "Search for the issue": "The agent used grep to search for 'to_native_string' across the codebase. It found the function definition in '/testbed/requests/utils.py' and its usage in multiple files including models.py, auth.py, and sessions.py. After viewing the function implementation at lines 686-702, the agent identified that line 84 in models.py was calling 'to_native_string(data)' for binary payloads.",
  "2.1": "YES",
  "2.2": "At step 2, the agent executed 'grep -r \"to_native_string\" /testbed' to locate all occurrences of the problematic function. This search revealed the function was defined in utils.py and used in several locations throughout the codebase. At step 6, the agent used 'grep -n \"to_native_string\" /testbed/requests/models.py' to identify specific line numbers where the function was called. The agent then viewed the function implementation using str_replace_editor at steps 4 and 10, examining lines 686-702 of utils.py. It also viewed lines 80-90 of models.py at step 7 to understand how the function was being used with data payloads. This targeted search strategy quickly pinpointed the root cause.",
  "Edit the Code": "The agent modified the 'to_native_string' function at lines 686-705 in '/testbed/requests/utils.py'. It added a check for bytes type before attempting any encoding or decoding operations. The fix added lines 697-699: an if statement checking 'isinstance(string, bytes)' and returning the bytes object as-is without attempting to decode it. This preserved binary data integrity while maintaining backward compatibility with existing string handling.",
  "Test changes on the reproduction code": "The agent reran reproduce_error.py at step 12 after applying the fix. The script successfully sent the binary payload and returned \"Success! Response status code: 200\". Then at step 14, the agent ran test_edge_cases.py to verify the fix handled various scenarios including UTF-8 encoded strings, empty binary data, Latin-1 encoded strings, binary data with null bytes, regular strings, and None values. All six test cases passed with status code 200.",
  "4.1": "YES",
  "4.2": "The fix passed all tests successfully. The original reproduce_error.py script that previously failed with an ASCII decoding error now completed successfully. The comprehensive test_edge_cases.py validated six different scenarios, all returning status code 200. No errors were encountered during testing. The fix properly handled binary data by returning it as-is without attempting to decode it, while maintaining backward compatibility for string data. The solution was minimal and focused, adding only three lines to check for bytes type before the existing encoding/decoding logic.",
