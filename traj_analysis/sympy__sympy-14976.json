  "Issue Summary": "The issue was in the MpmathPrinter class in 'testbed/sympy/printing/pycode.py'. When using lambdify with modules='mpmath', rational numbers weren't wrapped with mpmath functions, causing precision loss. The rationals like S(1)/3 or 232/3 were printed as plain Python division expressions instead of being converted to mpmath.fraction calls, which meant they lost precision when used in high-precision calculations with nsolve.",
  "Interaction Summary": "The agent systematically explored the codebase to understand how lambdify processes different number types. It examined the printing modules, particularly pycode.py and the MpmathPrinter class. The agent created multiple test scripts to verify mpmath's behavior with rationals and to confirm that the issue existed. Throughout the process, it methodically checked inheritance hierarchies and compared how Float vs Rational types were handled.",
  "Reproduction Code": "The agent created 'reproduce_issue.py' at step 13 to demonstrate the problem. It later created more comprehensive test scripts including 'test_mpmath_rational.py' at step 24, 'test_mpmath_rational2.py' at step 26, 'test_mpmath_rational3.py' at step 29, and 'test_final_verification.py' at step 52.",
  "1.1": "YES",
  "1.2": "The agent created reproduce_issue.py at step 13 which showed that rationals like 232/3 and 1/3 weren't wrapped with mpmath.mpf() when using lambdify with mpmath. The script used inspect.getsource() to examine generated function code, revealing plain division operators instead of mpmath wrappers. After implementing the fix, test scripts at steps 29-37 verified various edge cases like integers, complex rationals, large rationals, and rationals in multiplication. The test_final_verification.py script at step 52 comprehensively tested the original issue, simple rational cases, and backwards compatibility with other modules.",
  "Search for the issue": "The agent used grep searches and file viewing to locate how rational numbers were printed. It searched for '_print_Rational' methods across the codebase at step 10, finding implementations in multiple printer classes. The agent traced the inheritance chain from MpmathPrinter to PythonCodePrinter to CodePrinter to StrPrinter, discovering that MpmathPrinter lacked a _print_Rational method.",
  "2.1": "YES",
  "2.2": "The agent executed grep commands to search for '_print_Rational' in various files at steps 10-18. It found that str.py contained the base implementation at line 594 which simply returned '%s/%s' % (expr.p, expr.q). The agent verified that pycode.py's MpmathPrinter had no _print_Rational override, meaning it inherited the plain division behavior. It also examined how MpmathPrinter handled Float types at step 16, noting it wrapped them with mpmath.mpf(). The agent then researched mpmath's fraction function capabilities through test scripts at steps 24-29 to determine the correct implementation approach.",
  "Edit the Code": "The patch was applied at step 32 in 'testbed/sympy/printing/pycode.py'. The agent added a _print_Rational method to the MpmathPrinter class starting at line 334. The implementation checks if the denominator equals 1 and returns just the numerator in that case, otherwise it returns a call to mpmath.fraction with both numerator and denominator wrapped using self._print() and formatted with self._module_format().",
  "Test changes on the reproduction code": "The agent ran multiple test scripts to verify the fix. At step 33, it tested basic rational wrapping showing S(1)/3 now generated 'fraction(1, 3)'. Steps 35-37 tested edge cases including integers, simplified rationals, and large numbers. Steps 39-47 ran existing sympy tests like test_mpmath_lambda and test_mpmath_precision to ensure no regressions. The comprehensive test_final_verification.py at step 52 confirmed the original issue was fixed and backwards compatibility was maintained.",
  "4.1": "YES",
  "4.2": "All tests passed successfully. The fix correctly wrapped rationals with mpmath.fraction() while maintaining backwards compatibility with other modules like math and sympy. Edge cases like integers and rationals with denominator 1 were properly simplified. The original issue from the PR description was resolved, with 232/3 now appearing as fraction(-232, 3) instead of plain division. High-precision tests confirmed that mpmath operations maintained full precision. Existing sympy test suite tests for lambdify and mpmath passed without any failures.",
