Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the source code of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.",

Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the source code of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.",

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2.

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the source code of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.",

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the source code of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.",

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command.

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the source code of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.",

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the source code of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.",

Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the source code of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.",

Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start.

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Instead, you should explore the file system to find the file before working on it.\n</IMPORTANT>\n\nYou have access to the following functions:\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #1: bash ----\nDescription: Execute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the source code of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.",

The problem was that the `urlsplit` function in these Python versions strips newline characters before splitting, which means the URLValidator doesn't detect them as invalid.\n\nOur solution was to modify the URLValidator to explicitly check for all Unicode whitespace characters before proceeding with validation. This ensures that URLs containing newlines, carriage returns, tabs, or other whitespace characters are rejected, regardless of the Python version.\n\nThe changes we made:\n\n1. Added a check for whitespace characters in the URLValidator's `__call__` method\n2. Used `c.isspace()` to check for all Unicode whitespace characters, not just `\\r`, `\\n`, and `\\t`\n\nThis fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue mentioned in the PR description.

Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>.

Can be empty to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `ctrl+c` to interrupt the currently running process.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: submit ----\nDescription: Finish the interaction when the task is complete OR if the assistant cannot proceed further with the task.\nNo parameters are required for this function.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\nNotes for using the `str_replace` command:\n* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique\n* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/repo/file.py` or `/repo`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\nProvide any reasoning for the function call here.\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- Always provide reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call (not after)\n</IMPORTANT>",

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the source code of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.",

The problem was that the `urlsplit` function in these Python versions strips newline characters before splitting, which means the URLValidator doesn't detect them as invalid.\n\nOur solution was to modify the URLValidator to explicitly check for all Unicode whitespace characters before proceeding with validation. This ensures that URLs containing newlines, carriage returns, tabs, or other whitespace characters are rejected, regardless of the Python version.\n\nThe changes we made:\n\n1. Added a check for whitespace characters in the URLValidator's `__call__` method\n2. Used `c.isspace()` to check for all Unicode whitespace characters, not just `\\r`, `\\n`, and `\\t`\n\nThis fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue mentioned in the PR description.

However, the bpo-43882 fix changes URL splitting behavior to strip all instances of LF, CR and tab characters before splitting, so they never reach the validator.\\nI'm not sure what the best fix is. One option is to reject URLs containing the forbidden characters early. Another is to go with the new recommendation and assume that LF, CR and tabs are to stripped silently.\\n\",\"extra_fields\":{},\"type\":\"text\",\"id\":\"django__django-14349\"},\"output_dir\":\"DEFAULT\",\"actions\":{\"open_pr\":false,\"pr_config\":{\"skip_if_commits_reference_issue\":true},\"apply_patch_locally\":false},\"env_var_path\":null}",
