  "Traj ID": "matplotlib__matplotlib-26113",
  "Issue Summary": "The issue in this trajectory comes from Matplotlib's internal rendering and transformation logic failing for a specific plot configuration. When certain shapes or coordinates are processed, Matplotlib passes invalid or unexpected values deeper into the rendering pipeline. Because some checks are missing, these values later cause exceptions or incorrect visual output. The bug appears to involve inconsistent assumptions about the structure of input data during coordinate transforms or layout calculations.",
  
  "Interaction Summary": "The agent spends most of the trajectory navigating Matplotlib's source code and searching through modules related to transforms, rendering, axes behavior, and artists. After forming early guesses, it creates a reproduction script to isolate the problem. From that point onward, the agent repeatedly edits internal functions and re-tests the reproduction script to see if the fix worked. Even after multiple attempts, it cannot pinpoint the exact faulty function or behavior, so none of the patches resolve the issue. The bug remains unsolved at the end of the trajectory.",
  
  "Reproduction Code": "Reproduction code is created around trajectory steps: [8].",
  "1.1": "YES",
  "1.2": "At step 8, the agent creates a small reproduction script that builds a minimal plot designed to trigger the rendering failure. It re-runs this script after every code change to check whether the behavior improves. The reproduction environment makes it easy to see whether edits had any effect. However, the script continues failing in every run, showing that none of the agent's modifications addressed the real problem.",
  
  "Search for the issue": "The agent runs search/navigation commands in steps: [3, 6, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 38, 39].",
  "2.1": "YES",
  "2.2": "The agent performs extensive searches across the Matplotlib codebase. It uses grep to look for functions related to transforms, coordinate calculations, and rendering. It explores directories such as transforms/, axes/, and artist/ to understand how Matplotlib processes shapes and coordinate values. The agent revisits these modules multiple times as earlier hypotheses fail. Despite covering many possible areas, it does not find a clear location where the faulty logic originates, so the search process remains exploratory.",
  
  "Edit the Code": "The agent makes several speculative edits using str_replace_editor, mostly adding checks for invalid inputs or adjusting calculation steps within transformation functions. Since the root cause was never confidently identified, these edits are based on partial guesses rather than confirmed faults. None of the patches fix the issue exposed by the reproduction script.",
  
  "Test changes on the reproduction code": "After each patch, the agent runs the reproduction script again. Every execution shows the same failure pattern, indicating that the attempted fixes do not affect the behavior. Even though the agent reviews the printed errors and output closely, it is unable to refine its patches in a productive direction. The reproduction script stays consistent throughout and continues failing.",
  
  "4.1": "NO",
  "4.2": "All reproduction tests fail with errors involving invalid rendering steps or coordinate transformation exceptions. The failures look the same across all iterations, which suggests that the attempted edits never reached the part of the pipeline responsible for the bug. Because the error output does not change, the agent has no strong signals to guide further fixes. The issue remains unresolved by the end of the trajectory.",
