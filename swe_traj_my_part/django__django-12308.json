  "Traj ID": "django__django-12308",
  "Issue Summary": "This issue is about Django not correctly resolving certain URL patterns, especially when the patterns have unusual or slightly broken segments. Django doesn't fully validate or clean these patterns before trying to process them, which causes incorrect matches or exceptions during URL resolution. Because of this missing validation step, Django's routing breaks on certain edge-case inputs.",
  
  "Interaction Summary": "The agent explores Django's codebase to understand how URLs are processed. It uses many search commands to look through files related to URL parsing and resolution. After forming some guesses, it creates a reproduction script to isolate the bug. It then tries several edits to the resolver code and runs the script after each change. Even after many attempts, the issue still remains and the agent cannot produce a working fix.",
  
  "Reproduction Code": "Reproduction code is created around trajectory steps: [12].",
  "1.1": "YES",
  "1.2": "At step 12, the agent writes a small script that sets up a Django configuration designed to trigger the bug. It uses this script after every patch attempt to check if anything improved. The script consistently shows the same failure, helping the agent confirm that none of the changes fixed the underlying issue.",
  
  "Search for the issue": "The agent runs search/navigation commands in many steps: [2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 34, 37, 38, 40, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 62, 63].",
  "2.1": "YES",
  "2.2": "The agent searches through Django using commands like grep and cd to inspect modules such as resolvers.py, urls.py, and path utilities. It tries to trace how patterns are interpreted step by step. Although it finds many relevant functions, none of them clearly contain the bug. The search becomes broad and exploratory, but still doesn't reveal the exact faulty logic.",
  
  "Edit the Code": "The agent edits several parts of the resolver and pattern parsing code using str_replace_editor. These edits try to add new checks or modify logic based on the agent's guesses. However, since the true cause isn't known, the edits are scattered and none of them fix the issue.",
  
  "Test changes on the reproduction code": "After each edit, the agent runs the reproduction script again. Every run still fails with the same type of URL resolution errors or exceptions. Even though the agent checks the logs to see if anything changed, all results stay the same. This shows that the edits didn't affect the core problem.",
  
  "4.1": "NO",
  "4.2": "All tests keep failing with the same behavior. The resolver still misparses the problematic pattern and raises exceptions early in the process. The agent notices that the output never changes across iterations, which suggests that the edits did not touch the real source of the problem. The issue remains unresolved.",
