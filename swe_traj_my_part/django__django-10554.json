  "Traj ID": "django__django-10554",
  "Issue Summary": "This issue comes from Django's URL resolver not handling certain regex like URL patterns correctly. Some patterns are basically too strange or too loosely checked, and Django tries to compile them anyway. Because there isn't a proper validation step, the resolver gets confused and fails on specific edge case URLs. This leads to broken tests and incorrect URL matching.",
  
  "Interaction Summary": "The agent spends a lot of time exploring Django's codebase by moving around folders and checking files. It tries to understand how URL patterns are parsed internally. After that, it creates a small script to reproduce the bug and uses it over and over to check if edits help. The agent edits several parts of the resolver, tests again, and repeats the cycle. But none of the changes actually fix the issue.",
  
  "Reproduction Code": "Reproduction code is created around trajectory steps: [18].",
  "1.1": "YES",
  "1.2": "At step 18 the agent creates a script that loads Django's resolver and tries running a failing URL. It uses this script every time it makes a new edit. The script helps the agent check if the behavior changes at all. The agent keeps rerunning it to compare outputs before and after patches. Even though it relies heavily on this script, the results always show the same failure.",
  
  "Search for the issue": "The agent runs search/navigation commands in many steps, checking a lot of different Django files.",
  "2.1": "YES",
  "2.2": "The agent uses grep, ls, cd, and similar tools to look through Django's URL-related modules. It checks files like resolvers.py and urls.py, hoping to spot the exact place where the pattern handling goes wrong. It jumps around the project a lot as it forms new guesses. But even with all the searching, it never finds one clear broken line of code. Most of the searching ends up being trial and error.",
  
  "Edit the Code": "The agent edits several parts of the resolver using the str_replace_editor tool. These changes include adjusting conditions or trying small tweaks to the logic. But the edits are guesses because the root cause is never fully understood. None of the edits fix the issue.",
  
  "Test changes on the reproduction code": "After each patch, the agent runs the reproduction script again. The script fails every single time, showing that the underlying problem is still there. The output and errors look almost identical after every attempt.",
  "4.1": "NO",
  "4.2": "All tests continue to fail. The resolver still misreads or mishandles the regex-like URL patterns. Errors during pattern compilation keep showing up. Nothing the agent tries changes the behavior. This shows the fixes never reached the real cause of the bug.",
