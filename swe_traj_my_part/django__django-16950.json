  "Traj ID": "django__django-16950",
  "Issue Summary": "This issue comes from Django's URL resolver not handling malformed or ambiguous URL patterns correctly. When certain path components contain invalid or unusual segments, the resolver processes them incorrectly during pattern compilation. This leads to exceptions or incorrect route matching. The likely cause is missing validation in the step where patterns are converted into regexes, allowing bad inputs to reach deeper parts of the resolver logic and break assumptions about valid structure.",
  
  "Interaction Summary": "The agent spends most of the trajectory navigating the Django codebase and running searches to understand how URL patterns are parsed. It examines several modules and eventually creates multiple reproduction scripts to isolate the failing behavior. After that, the agent tries many patches using the editor tool and tests each one by re-running the reproduction code. Despite many attempts and lots of exploration, none of the edits fix the issue. The trajectory is dominated by repeated searching, guessing, and re-testing without finding a working solution.",
  
  "Reproduction Code": "Reproduction code is created around trajectory steps: [14, 24, 26].",
  "1.1": "YES",
  "1.2": "The agent creates three reproduction scripts at steps 14, 24, and 26. Each one tries to trigger the URL resolution failure using very small Django setups. The first script captures the basic failing example. The later scripts include more variations of the problematic pattern to test whether different inputs change the behavior. The agent uses these scripts heavily after every patch attempt. All of them always fail, showing that the underlying problem never gets fixed.",
  
  "Search for the issue": "The agent runs search/navigation commands in steps: [4, 9, 12, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 31, 34, 35, 36, 37, 41, 44, 46, 49, 50, 52, 54, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, 68, 71, 72, 74, 75].",
  "2.1": "YES",
  "2.2": "The agent performs many searches using grep, cd, and directory inspection to find where Django handles URL patterns. It looks at resolvers.py, converters, and parts of urls.py, trying to track how malformed patterns move through the system. Whenever new ideas come up, the agent jumps to different modules and inspects nearby code. Even with a lot of searching, nothing clearly stands out as the root cause. The agent repeatedly revisits the same files as earlier guesses fail and new ones come up.",
  
  "Edit the Code": "The agent applies many speculative edits to Django's resolver code. These include adding validation checks, changing how patterns are normalized, modifying how converters are used, and trying to sanitize problematic segments before regex compilation. Some files are edited multiple times. But because the true cause was never identified, these edits end up being guesses rather than targeted fixes. None of the patches resolve the problem.",
  
  "Test changes on the reproduction code": "After each patch, the agent runs one or more of its reproduction scripts. Every script shows the same failure each time: the resolver still breaks on malformed patterns. The error messages do not meaningfully change, which makes it difficult for the agent to learn from them. Testing becomes repetitive, and no patch brings the resolver closer to the expected behavior.",
  
  "4.1": "NO",
  "4.2": "All reproduction tests fail throughout the trajectory. The errors involve broken pattern interpretation, regex compilation failures, or unresolved path components. Even after major edits, the failures remain identical, showing that the core issue was never reached. Malformed segments continue to pass through the resolver pipeline unchecked. The fact that three different reproduction scripts all fail in the same way confirms that the bug is deeper than the areas the agent modified.",
