  "Traj ID": "matplotlib__matplotlib-26113",
  "Issue Summary": "The issue in this trajectory involves Matplotlib’s internal rendering or transformation logic failing when encountering a particular configuration of plot elements. The bug originates from how Matplotlib handles shape transformation, coordinate conversion, or layout computation for certain objects. A missing validation step allows invalid or unexpected values to pass into later rendering stages, eventually causing an exception or incorrect plot output. The underlying defect is rooted in inconsistent assumptions about input structure in part of the rendering pipeline.",
  "Interaction Summary": "The agent explores Matplotlib’s codebase through extensive navigation and searching. It inspects modules related to rendering, transforms, patches, and axes configuration. After forming initial hypotheses, the agent generates a reproduction script early in the trajectory to isolate the bug. It then iteratively attempts modifications to internal methods and validates each change against the reproduction script. Despite multiple edit–test cycles, the agent is unable to identify the precise function responsible for the issue and does not produce a working patch. The interaction concludes with the bug unresolved.",
  "Reproduction Code": "Reproduction code is created around trajectory steps: [8].",
  "1.1": "YES",
  "1.2": "At step 8, the agent generates a reproduction script intended to isolate and replicate the Matplotlib rendering failure. The script constructs a minimal plot configuration that triggers the problematic behavior. The agent relies heavily on this script in subsequent steps, re-running it after each attempted modification to measure whether the behavior improves. The reproduction environment makes it possible to detect when edits produce no change in output. Ultimately, the reproduction script consistently fails, demonstrating that none of the agent’s edits successfully address the underlying defect.",
  "Search for the issue": "The agent runs search/navigation commands in steps: [3, 6, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 38, 39].",
  "2.1": "YES",
  "2.2": "The agent performs multiple rounds of searching across the Matplotlib repository. It uses 'grep' to identify occurrences of relevant transformation or rendering functions and navigates using 'cd' and 'ls' to inspect directories like transforms, axes, and artist modules. The agent attempts to trace how Matplotlib processes shape parameters, bounding boxes, and coordinate transforms by searching for functions associated with these behaviors. As it inspects several files, it repeatedly revisits modules when earlier hypotheses fail. Despite extensive search coverage, the agent is unable to isolate a specific faulty line or root logic error, causing the search to remain exploratory and inconclusive.",
  "Edit the Code": "Using the str_replace_editor tool, the agent attempts speculative modifications targeting internal rendering or transform logic. These edits include inserting additional checks to guard against invalid inputs or adjusting existing calculations to handle problematic cases. Since the agent does not fully identify the root cause, these edits are based on partial hypotheses and do not successfully address the underlying issue. The patches therefore fail to correct the behavior demonstrated in the reproduction script.",
  "Test changes on the reproduction code": "The agent repeatedly executes its reproduction script after each code modification. Each test run continues to exhibit the same rendering failure, indicating the attempted edits did not correct the underlying behavior. The agent examines printed outputs and error traces produced during these executions but is unable to refine its patch attempts based on these signals. The reproduction script remains a reliable diagnostic tool, showing consistent failure throughout the trajectory.",
  "4.1": "NO",
  "4.2": "Every reproduction test fails with errors involving invalid rendering operations or exceptions thrown during coordinate transformation. The agent observes consistent failures regardless of the changes applied to the code. These errors confirm that the edits do not reach or repair the portion of the rendering pipeline responsible for the bug. The lack of variation in the reproduction output shows that the attempted patches have minimal impact on the system’s behavior. The trajectory ends without a successful fix.",
