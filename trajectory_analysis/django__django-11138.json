  "Traj ID": "django__django-11138",
  "Issue Summary": "This issue is about Django failing to handle certain URL configuration patterns, especially when they involve nested or unusual arguments. Some parts of the URL resolver don't properly check or interpret these inputs, which leads to crashes or wrong routing behavior. Because of this, Django builds an inconsistent URL pattern tree and downstream routing stops working for those cases.",
  
  "Interaction Summary": "The agent explores a lot of Django's URL-handling code, moving around folders and searching for functions related to URL resolution. It tries to understand which part of the resolver is failing. After locating possible areas, the agent creates a small script to reproduce the bug and uses it repeatedly while making edits. It tries multiple fixes by adjusting argument handling, but none of the changes actually solve the underlying problem.",
  
  "Reproduction Code": "Reproduction code is created around trajectory steps: [12].",
  "1.1": "YES",
  "1.2": "At step 12, the agent creates a small script that triggers the failing configuration. It uses this script many times while testing its patches. The script shows whether the resolver still crashes or behaves incorrectly. Even after several attempts, every run still fails, showing that the edits didn't fix the issue.",
  
  "Search for the issue": "The agent runs search/navigation commands in many steps to track down where the bug might come from.",
  "2.1": "YES",
  "2.2": "The agent uses grep, ls, cd, and other search tools to look through Django's URL-related modules. It checks functions involved in URLConf parsing and resolver logic. It revisits several files while forming new ideas, but none of the searches lead to a clear single faulty line. The search ends up being broad and exploratory.",
  
  "Edit the Code": "The agent makes multiple edits to Django's URL resolver using the str_replace_editor tool. It tries changing conditions, adding validation, and adjusting how arguments are handled. However, all of these changes are guesses, since the exact root cause is not clearly identified. None of the edits fix the behavior.",
  
  "Test changes on the reproduction code": "After each patch, the agent runs the reproduction script again. Every test still fails, showing exceptions or incorrect URL resolution results. The agent reviews the outputs but cannot find a direction that leads toward a working fix. All test runs show the same failure.",
  "4.1": "NO",
  "4.2": "None of the patches fix the problem. The resolver continues to mis-handle certain URL configurations, sometimes returning None or raising exceptions. The results are basically the same for every attempt, showing that the underlying issue was never reached.",
